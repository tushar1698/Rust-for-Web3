# Rust for Web3

Welcome to **Rust for Web3**, a dynamic repository dedicated to exploring the intersection of Rust and Web3 technologies. This space is a growing collection of Rust-based projects, tools, and resources tailored for blockchain development, showcasing real-world applications and insights into Web3 security and programming.

---

## 📂 Future Plans for this Repo
This repository will evolve over time to include a wide variety of Rust projects and resources, including but not limited to:

1. **Web3 Development Tools**: Programs and utilities for interacting with blockchain protocols like Ethereum and Cosmos.
2. **Smart Contract Bots**: Automated tools for tasks like token swaps, liquidity provision, and monitoring.
3. **Audit Reports**: Security analysis of smart contracts, complete with identified vulnerabilities and recommended fixes.
4. **Educational Snippets**: Practical examples, templates, and code snippets to accelerate your Web3 development with Rust.

## 🌟 Current Highlights
### **Price Bot**
The first addition to this repository is a **Rust-based Price Bot**. This bot fetches real-time price data from blockchain oracles like Chainlink, demonstrating:
- How to use [ethers-rs](https://docs.rs/ethers/latest/ethers/) to interact with Ethereum smart contracts.
- Parsing and utilizing ABIs for contract calls.
- Efficient handling of asynchronous Rust code.

**Note**: This section will be updated as I start adding more Codebases or Audit Reports

## 🛠️ Planned Features
Here’s what’s on the roadmap for **Rust for Web3**:
- **Cross-chain Tools**: Projects showcasing interoperability between blockchains using Rust libraries.
- **CosmWasm Examples**: Smart contract implementations on Cosmos SDK.
- **Rust Audit Reports**: It will help other researchers into identifying and mitigating security issues in smart contracts.
- **Optimized Web3 Algorithms**: Rust implementations of common blockchain algorithms like staking and consensus.

Stay tuned for regular updates and new additions!
